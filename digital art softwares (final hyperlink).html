                <span>Adobe Photoshop</span>
                <p>Adobe Photoshop is still the industry standard when it comes to digital art, and remains one of the best digital art applications. If you're working professionally, it's almost certain that you'll be expected to use it at some point and there's good reason for its dominance (I use this software everyday for creating images for CreativeBloq). Photoshop is basically good at everything, not just photo editing but also drawing, digital painting, and plenty more. It now also has an ethical AI, called Adobe Firefly for generative images.</p>

                <span>Procreate</span>
                <p>Procreate is, without a doubt, the best iPad drawing app around at the moment. It's an impressive drawing tool that's gained a big following among artists, and it's packed with powerful tools that make it a delight to use. You can work with hundreds of layers if you need to, and there are masks, blend modes and over 130 customisable Procreate brushes to play with. The typography tools add a whole extra layer of creative functionality too.</p>

                <span>Rebelle 7</span>
                <p>If Corel Painter is a little too expensive, Rebelle 7 could be your best alternative. Featuring more than 240 brush presets, it's designed to mimic the way that paint behaves in the real world. It's one of the best digital art software options for creating realistic-looking watercolours or oils with plenty of thick impasto effects.</p>
            </li>

                <img src="assets/img/eANgssrSteWTBqNTFz7XwM-970-80.png.webp" alt="4ap" />
                <span>Affinity Photo</span>
                <p>Affinity Photo is your best alternative to Photoshop. It's a one-time purchase, so once you've paid the initial cost of the software, you're set. In terms of power and performance, it's pretty much on a par with Photoshop, though it lacks some of Adobe's most advanced features like content-aware fill. (If you want an alternative to Adobe Illustrator, take a look at Infinity Designer.)</p>

                <span>Corel Painter 2023</span>
                <p>As its name implies, Corel Painter 2023 is especially good software for digital painting. The latest update improves on the paint flow and mixing system, particularly the new Fluid Brush system enables you to build layers of paint in a realistic manner.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <img src="assets/img/qoCEpRBwDSJe9EU8yqrjNS-970-80.jpg.webp" alt="6cspp" />
                <span>Clip Studio Paint Pro</span>
                <p>For manga art and comic creation, Clip Studio Paint is one of the best digital art software programs. It delivers a natural, traditional feel, complete with pen pressure detection to give you realistic-looking pen strokes if you're working on a graphics tablet.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <img src="assets/img/gG7ARTmJPzRkwxq7psYSj8-970-80.jpg.webp" alt="7arv" />
                <span>ArtRage Vitae</span>
                <p>ArtRage has been one of the best digital art applications for many years now and has built up a loyal following among artists and illustrators. It's easy to see why since this is another app that offers realistic paint texture and colour but at a price that's a lot more attractive than that of Corel Painter (see above).</p>

                <img src="assets/img/7H3GxeyAyaWMF54grDTWZ3-970-80.jpg.webp" alt="8k" />
                <span>Krita</span>
                <p>Krita has been quietly doing its thing since 2004, and it's one of the best-kept secrets in the digital art world. Free and open source, it has a great set of tools as well as an intuitive and customisable interface that you can set up in the best way to work with your style of painting.</p>
            </li>

                <span>MediBang Paint Pro</span>
                <p>Looking for a free alternative to Clip Studio Paint for creating manga art or comics? Paint Pro from Japanese company MediBang is well worth investigating. It's a free and lightweight digital drawing tool that comes with 800 free pre-made tones and backgrounds, as well as over 50 brushes, easy comic panel creation tools and a massive selection of free fonts.</p>
            </li>

                <span>Artweaver 7</span>
                <p>If you're on a tight budget and some of the best digital art software above seems too expensive, Artweaver 7 is a very attractive option. It features lots of customisable brushes for a real-world look, and it's easy to get to grips with, with a straightforward interface that you can customise to suit your needs.</p>
